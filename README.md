Program takes the user's string type input and converts it to an integer type,
Then it stores the data in a variable called x_value,
Calculates the given equation(square root of, 25 minus x squared) via math module functions,
And stores the result in y_value,
Next, program rounds the y_value to 3 decimals and subtracts the rounded value from y_value,
And stores the result in variable called subtract_y_rounded,
In the end,
Program prints out (x,y) pairs for first line,
Program prints out y_value and rounded y_value for what x_value is for second line,
Program prints out rounded result of y_value minus rounded y_value to 5 decimal for third line.


~To Run The Code You Will Need To Follow The Instruction In The Terminal Upon Running The Program~

Note: Program has a domain for input no greater than 5 and no smaller than -5,
any number out of this range will cause Value Error,
however my script has blocks of codes that check for valid entries.
Note: Program does not return negative root values for Y, this is a Logic Error,
I added an unicode that allows the terminal output appear,
with both positive and negative signs.
